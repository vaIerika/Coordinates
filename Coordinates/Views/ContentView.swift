This wealthy count reportedly fell in love with a charming French noblewoman, to whom he wanted to propose. Therefore, in order to make her feel at home, he had had his residences rebuilt and redecorated in the fashion of the French manor houses. \n\nUnfortunately, by the time the construction works on Budmerice Manor House and other residences (for example the castle in Bojnice) were finished, his beloved countess married someone else. After that, J√°n P√°lffy never married. Nowadays, the interior of the Budmerice Manor House is closed to the public. The building is waiting for restoration and its further fate has yet to be decided. \n\nIt may once again serve as the Slovak Writers Home, just like it used to be from after the end of World War II until 2011, when it offered a peaceful and quiet environment to Slovak writers such as Margita Figuli, Ivan Krasko, J√°n Smrek or Rudolf Dobi√°≈°, just to mention a few."

            bojnice.details = "Bojnice Castle was first mentioned in written records in 1113, in a document held at the Zobor Abbey. Originally built as a wooden fort, it was gradually replaced by stone, with the outer walls being shaped according to the uneven rocky terrain. Its first owner was Matthew III Cs√°k, who received it in 1302 from the King Ladislaus V of Hungary. \n\nLater, in the 15th century, it was owned by King Matthias Corvinus, who gave it to his illegitimate son John Corvinus in 1489. Matthias liked to visit Bojnice and it was here that he worked on his royal decrees. He used to dictate them under a linden tree, which is now known as the 'Linden tree of King Matthias'. After his death the castle became the property of the Z√°polya family (see John Z√°polya). The Thurz√≥s, the richest family in the northern Kingdom of Hungary, acquired the castle in 1528 and undertook its major reconstruction. The former fortress was turned into a Renaissance castle. From 1646 on, the castle's owners were the P√°lffys, who continued to rebuild the castle.\n\nFinally, the last famous castle owner from the P√°lffy family, Count J√°nos Ferenc P√°lffy (1829-1908), made a complex romantic reconstruction from 1888 to 1910 and created today's imitation of French castles of the Loire valley. He not only had the castle built, but also was the architect and graphic designer. He utilized his artistic taste and love for collecting pieces of art.[citation needed] He was one of the greatest collectors of antiques, tapestries, drawings, paintings and sculptures of his time. After his death and long quarrels, his heirs sold many precious pieces of art from the castle and then, on 25 February 1939, sold the castle, the health spa, and the surrounding land to Czech entrepreneur Jan Anton√≠n Ba≈•a (owner the shoe company Bata).\n\nAfter 1945, when Ba≈•a's property was confiscated by the Czechoslovak government, the castle became the seat of several state institutions. On 9 May 1950, a fire broke out in the castle, but it was rebuilt at government expense. After this reconstruction, a museum specializing in the documentation and presentation of the era of architectural neo-styles was opened here. Bojnice Museum is now part of the Slovak National Museum today."
